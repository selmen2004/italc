## What is iTALC?

iTALC is a powerful didactical tool which allows teachers to view and control
computer labs and interact with students. It's available in different languages and
provides lots of useful features such as:

  * see what's going on in computer labs by using overview mode and make snapshots
  * remote control computers to support and help users
  * broadcast teacher's screen to students in realtime by using demo mode
    (either in fullscreen or in a window)
  * lock workstations for attracting attention to teacher
  * send text messages to students
  * powering on/off and rebooting computers remote
  * remote logoff and remote execution of arbitrary commands/scripts
  * home schooling - iTALC's network-technology is not restricted to a subnet
    and therefore students at home can join lessons via VPN connections just by
    installing the iTALC service
